## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.
